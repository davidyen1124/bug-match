        BUGMATCH SUPER-CHILL PUBLIC LICENSE  v0.0.1
        (“Because rules are just comments anyway”)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Preamble
--------
You found some code. Cool. This license exists mainly
to fill that awkward empty spot in your repo and to give
the lawyers heartburn. Read on if you must, but honestly
nothing here will stop you from doing whatever you were
already planning to do.

1. Unlimited Permission to Do Stuff
-----------------------------------
You may, free of charge and without asking our mom:
•   use, copy, fork, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
    sub-license, sell, rent, fold into a papier-mâché swan,
    or leave running on a Raspberry Pi in a dark closet.
•   Basically anything, forever, in any jurisdiction,
    real or simulated.

2. Attribution?
---------------
Nah, but if you shout us out on Twitter/X/Mastodon/
Carrier-Pigeon we’ll send you a virtual high-five.  
Totally optional, mildly appreciated.

3. No Warranty, No Refunds, No Regrets
--------------------------------------
The code is provided “AS IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” and
occasionally “ON FIRE.”  
If it bricks your laptop, summons eldritch DevOps demons,
or causes the heat-death of your sprint velocity, that’s
on you, champ.

4. Liability
------------
By using this code you agree we owe you absolutely
nothing—no fixes, no support, no emotional validation.
(We’re developers, we barely validate our own feelings.)

5. Compiler Optimizations
-------------------------
None detected. Proceed accordingly.

Closing Haiku
-------------
    Merge the pull request,
    Bugs and features intertwined—
    Git blame laughs softly.
